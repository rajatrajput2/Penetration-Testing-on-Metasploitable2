Exploitation Steps and Mitigation
Exploitation Steps

Reconnaissance (Nmap Scan)

Ran nmap -sV 192.168.56.104

Discovered open ports:

21 (FTP â€“ vsftpd 2.3.4)

22 (SSH)

Other services (Tomcat, MySQL, etc.).

Exploitation (Metasploit)

Used exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor.

Successfully gained root shell access.

Post-Exploitation

Dumped sensitive files: /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.

Used John the Ripper with a custom wordlist to crack msfadmin password.

Verified with Hydra brute force (msfadmin:msfadmin was found).

 Findings

Critical: vsftpd 2.3.4 contains a known backdoor.

High: Weak credentials (msfadmin:msfadmin).

High: Password hashes were easily crackable with a simple wordlist.

 Mitigation

Update software: Patch or remove vulnerable services like vsftpd 2.3.4.

Disable default accounts: Remove msfadmin or any weak accounts.

Strong authentication: Use SSH keys or complex passwords.

Limit exposure: Restrict unnecessary open ports and services.

Monitoring: Enable intrusion detection to detect brute-force attempts.
